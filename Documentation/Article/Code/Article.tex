\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document describes a project that can compare many images simultaneously in a synchronized manner. Such an application can be used in any ITK/VTK image processing pipelines; the programmer can use it to quickly visualize and compare intermediate results of used filters within the pipeline.The goals of this project are two folds: (i) to be integrated in gdb pretty debuggers \cite{McCornic-VisualDebug}  (for visual debugging of ITK pipelines), and, (ii) to provide a visual comparison widget for image-to-image plugins (ITK or VTK based filters).\\
This project is part of the Gofigure2 \cite{refGofigure2} development effort, an open-source, cross-platform application for visualizing, processing and analyzing of multidimensional microscopy data.

\tableofcontents

Based on Qt libraries \cite{refQT}, ITK \cite{ITKSoftwareGuide}, VTK \cite{vtkExamples}, and MegaVTK (a variant of vtkINRIA3D engine \cite{vtkINRIA}), we developed an application for multiple image visualization and comparison.
We provide the following items in this submission:
\begin{itemize}
 \item a set of classes and widgets for simple integration in a generic program developed by a user,
 \item an executable for command line usage (compareexample).
\end{itemize} 

\section{Principle}
In order to make these classes easy to use and modify, we created an instance of \code{QWidget} using a form (.ui file) for the GUI using Qt Designer. We also created a manager class that takes care of widgets creation, deletion and synchronization. The manager class (\code{QObject}) automatically takes care of the following issues:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Support for ITK images
  \item Support for VTK images
  \item Camera synchronization for fine comparison of results.
  \item QWidget inheritance for integration to an external application with Qt-based GUI.
%  \item doxygen documentation
\end{itemize}


\section{Examples and Documentation}
\subsection*{Documentation}
The library is composed of six classes :
\begin{description}
  \item [\href {http://gofigure2.sourceforge.net/Doxygen/Nightly/html/classQGoSynchronizedView.html}{QGoSynchronizedView}]
    abstract class for QGoSynchronizedView2D and QGoSynchronizedView3D.
    
  \item [\href {http://gofigure2.sourceforge.net/Doxygen/Nightly/html/classQGoSynchronizedView2D.html}{QGoSynchronizedView2D}]
    class is used to display a QWidget containing a two dimensional vtkimagedata* or itkimage*. QGoSynchronizedView2D provides the interface to synchronize cameras among several GoSynchronizedView2D objects.
    
  \item [\href {http://gofigure2.sourceforge.net/Doxygen/Nightly/html/classQGoSynchronizedView2DCallbacks.html}{QGoSynchronizedView2DCallbacks}]
    This object takes a list of QGoSynchronizedView objects and synchronizes their cameras by setting up appropriate callbacks. It is recommended to let the QGoSynchronizedViewManager deal with synchronization of objects since it simplifies the burden on the user significantly.
    
  \item [\href {http://gofigure2.sourceforge.net/Doxygen/Nightly/html/classQGoSynchronizedView3D.html}{QGoSynchronizedView3D}]class is used to display a QWidget containing a three dimensional vtkimagedata* or itkimage*. QGoSynchronizedView3D provides the interface to synchronize cameras among several GoSynchronizedView3D obhects.
  
  \item [\href {http://gofigure2.sourceforge.net/Doxygen/Nightly/html/classQGoSynchronizedView3DCallbacks.html}{QGoSynchronizedView3DCallbacks}]
    This object takes a list of QGoSynchronizedView objects and synchronizes their cameras by setting up appropriate callbacks. It is recommended to let the QGoSynchronizedViewManager deal with synchronization of objects since it simplifies the burden on the user significantly.
  
  \item [\href {http://gofigure2.sourceforge.net/Doxygen/Nightly/html/classQGoSynchronizedViewManager.html}{QGoSynchronizedViewManager}]
  High level class for QGoSynchronizedView2D, QGoSynchronizedView2DCallbacks, QGoSynchronizedView3D, QGoSynchronizedView3DCallbacks. This class deals with QGoSynchronizedViews for correct synchronization and provides a simple interface to create/delete/synchronize QGoSynchronizedViews. This class should be used with any class using QGoSynchronizedView widgets.
  
\end{description}

For implementation details, the reader is directed to the \href {http://gofigure2.sourceforge.net/Doxygen/Nightly/} {Doxygen documentation} and the source code which is extensively documented.

\subsection*{Code Snippets}
We introduce here the high level functions for creating QWidgets views and synchronizing visualizations:
\large
  \begin{lstlisting}[title={\large Creation of the visualization manager object}]{high_level_creation_visu_manager}
/* we simply create a new manager that will take care of 
 * creation/deletion of visualization and callbacks for us.
 */
QGoSynchronizedViewManager* ViewManager = new QGoSynchronizedViewManager();

// Visualize some images, process etc...

// Remember to delete ViewManager when no visualization is needed
delete ViewManager;
  \end{lstlisting}
\normalsize
\large
  \begin{lstlisting}[title={\large Visualization of a VTK image}]{high_level_creation_visu_VTK}
/*  the synchronization manager can create visualization windows given
 *  a valid pointer to a VTK image and 
 *  a string encoding the name of the visualization.
 */
ViewManager->newSynchronizedView("My VTK View", VTKSmartPointerToImage);
ViewManager->Update();
ViewManager->show();
  \end{lstlisting}
\normalsize
\large
  \begin{lstlisting}[title={\large Visualization of an ITK image}]{high_level_creation_visu_ITK}
/*  the synchronization manager can create visualization windows given
 *  a valid pointer to an ITK image,
 *  the template argument representing the image pixel type,
 *  a string encoding the name of the visualization.
 */
ViewManager->newSynchronizedView<InputPixelType>
  ("My ITK View", ITKSmartPointerToImage);
ViewManager->Update();
ViewManager->show();
  \end{lstlisting}
\normalsize
\large
  \begin{lstlisting}[title={\large Synchronization of the camera for several images}]{high_level_synchro_visu}
/*  the synchronization manager can synchronize the opened images 
 *  with a simple function call
 */
ViewManager->synchronizeOpenSynchronizedViews();
  \end{lstlisting}
\normalsize

\subsection*{Code Examples}
The code source is delivered with several tests and examples, located in Examples/GUI/lib/
Three examples illustrate the code snippets introduced in this article :
\begin{description}
  \item [compareexample] takes a list of 2D or 3D images as an input and displays them in synchronized viewer widgets.
  \item [comparepipelineexample] takes a 2D or 3D image as an argument and displays this images before and after filtering by a Gaussian filter. 
  \item [compareguiexample] shows how to create a very basic GUI using the functionalities provided by the \code{QGoSynchronized} classes. Figure ~\ref{fig:ImageCompareGUIquad} and ~\ref{fig:ImageCompareGUIXY} are screenshots of this application.
\end{description}


\section{Installation}

Get the latest version of the program from the GIT repository :
\begin{lstlisting}[language=ksh,numbers=none,captionpos=none]
$ git clone git://github.com/antonin07130/itkCompareProject.git 
$ cd itkCompareProject
\end{lstlisting}
Create a build directory where the compare examples will be compiled

\section{Future work}
In the future, we plan to :
\begin{itemize}
  \item Integrate this application into gdb pretty debugger for ITK.
  \item Add more pixel types for itk images (vector, tensor images),
  \item Add more features (generate the difference of two images, overlays...)
\end{itemize}
